## Data Encryption Standard (DES) Implementation in C++

This project offers a comprehensive implementation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm using C++. It serves as an educational tool to understand the intricacies of DES encryption and decryption processes.

### Overview

The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of digital data. It operates on 64-bit blocks and uses a 56-bit key. DES has been foundational in the field of cryptography, influencing many modern encryption algorithms. Despite its vulnerabilities to brute-force attacks, studying DES provides valuable insights into block cipher design and operation.

### Features

- **Complete DES Algorithm**: Implements the full DES encryption and decryption processes, including initial and final permutations, 16 Feistel rounds, and key scheduling.
- **User Interaction**: Command-line interface allowing users to choose between encryption and decryption modes.
- **Hexadecimal Input/Output**: Accepts plaintext and keys in hexadecimal format, displaying results similarly for clarity.
- **Educational Focus**: Designed to aid in understanding the step-by-step operations of DES.

### Files

- `Des_Implementation.cpp`: Contains the source code for the DES algorithm implementation.
- `Des_Implementation.exe`: Compiled executable for Windows systems.

### Compilation and Execution

#### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++` for Linux/macOS or MinGW for Windows).

#### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
